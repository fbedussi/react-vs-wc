# Performance comparison React vs Web Components

A simple performance test to compare React against Web Components (or the other way around :-) ).

# How it works
- Launch the react app with `npm i` and `npm start` from the root folder
- Launch the web component app with `npm i` and `npm start` from the `/wc` folder
- Open your perf tool of choice (eg. Chrome's devTools), test and compare
